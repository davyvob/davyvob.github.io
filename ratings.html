            <p>Apex Legends isnâ€™t done breaking records and continuing to improve the game with patches.</br>
                 We now know the official number of players that the title</br>
                 has reached in just one month. </br>
                 Apex Legends now has more than 50 million players in total. </br>
                This is across all three platforms it is available on and around the world. </br>
                That number is only set to grow from here.</br>
                In just one month, Apex Legends has more than 50 million players.</br>
                 That is crazy considering its closest competitor, Fortnite, only had that same number of players </br>
                 in a far longer period of time.
