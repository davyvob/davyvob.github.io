                <p> But liberation can come at a cost: the Frontier worlds were left barren by the war, and promised aid dwindled to nothing. With no way to support themselves,
                     those who remained had no choice but to leave their homes. The brave relocated to the Outlands.</p>

                           he saw what he had become at the hands of the Mercenary Syndicate and Hammond Robotics: a walking nightmare of steel and vestigial flesh.
                            His masters resurrected him as a simulacrum, snatching him from death’s embrace again and again and programming him to forget.</p>

                         In some ways, she still followed in his footsteps: it wasn't a Titan, but her ship offered a decent living. Her personal life, however, was anything but.
                          During the day, she smuggled precious cargo, and at night, went shot for shot with the outlaws and mercs in the bar. </p>

                        <p> Bloodhound is known across the Outlands as one of the greatest game hunters the Frontier has ever seen.</p>
                        <p>  The child of two engineers stationed at the New Dawn industrial plant on Talos, Bloodhound was taken in by their uncle Artur after a meltdown destroyed 
                         the facility and killed both their parents. Artur taught them the Old Ways, a belief system that focuses on the glory of nature and rejects modern technology. 
                         Yet Bloodhound was constantly drawn to technological marvels, and ultimately used both new and old methods in his quest for victory.</p>

                         So, this day, he decided to set the course record for a nearby Gauntlet by launching himself across the finish line – using a grenade. </p>

                         The one thing he took seriously was Holo-Pilot technology: introduced to the illusion-creating tech by his engineer mother, he poured over the mechanisms 
                         and learned all he could about them. Even when his brothers went MIA during the Frontier War, Mirage and his mother continued to develop holo devices,
